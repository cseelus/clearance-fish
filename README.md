# Fish Theme: clearance

A minimalist [fish shell](http://fishshell.com/) while decadent theme for people who use git.

Gives you the whole line for your commands while also showing you important information like the working directory and the git status just above. Adds a blank line before every new promt to keep everything clean and easy on your eyes.
