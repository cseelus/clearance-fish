# Fish Theme: clearance

A minimalist [fish shell](http://fishshell.com/) while decadent theme for people who use Git.

Gives you the whole line for your commands while also showing you important information just above:
- Virtual environment (if applicable)
- Working directory
- Git status

Adds a blank line before every new promt to keep everything clean and easy on your eyes.
